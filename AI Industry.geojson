Our first product is a soft, lightweight, back-assist exosuit for workers at high risk for back injuries due to bending and lifting.The device is fully passive and has no batteries, sensor or motors. Springs connecting the worker's torso to their thighs stretch when bending, squatting or lifting to support the back while working in a bent over posture and to assist the worker while lifting. The device has a switch to engage and disengage its assistance so that it doesn't get in the user's way when they are doing other tasks. The exosuit was researched and developed at Vanderbilt University and has numerous peer reviewed scientific studies to prove its effectiveness and comfort. HeroWear, LLC was founded in 2019 to bring this technology to the commercial market, and the exosuit was launched in March 2020.",
